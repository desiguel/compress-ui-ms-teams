# compress-ui-ms-teams

This chrome extension improves (IMHO) MS-Teams by removing a lot of the vertical and horizontal whitespace.
It is based off the work done by m0zgen (https://github.com/m0zgen/sysadminStyleForTeams) but with the potential for external css injection removed.

It's not perfect by any means as it assumes use of only one team so YMMV.
